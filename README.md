This repository is an anonymous code submission for Neurips 2022. It will be removed afterwards.

Our method is tested in OpenAI gym discrete control task, CartPole-v0, and two MuJoCo continuous control tasks. Thus it is required that MuJoCo and D4RL are both installed prior to using this repo.

After installing MuJoCo and D4RL, you can run the following script to make D4RL conform to our format:
```
python load_d4rl_data.py
```
